## About hacknical

### What is hacknical?

In my work experience, whether it is interviewing someone else, or being interviewed at work, is a very troublesome thing. The interviewer often understands the level of the interviewer, and some levels of good developers do not know how to show themselves well. In these states, the resume will often have this or that flaws:

- work experience either described too little, or too much nonsense
- No actual online work
- no visible public or open source code to let the interviewer understand their code level and style
- often like to use "XX" of such progress to express their own proficient in a language
- can not pass resume, see the interviewer's soul and style

So, for those who are under-experienced, if you do not have a good template or guide when writing your resume, it's easier to get into a self-talk. How to show their own experience, so that the interviewer to recognize their own level, it is hacknical want to solve the problem.
